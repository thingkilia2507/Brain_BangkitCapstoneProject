## [Executive Summary of The Project]():
Mental health, the core of human life, is a rising issue in Indonesia. The number of sufferers are increasing, yet not many are aware of this. The access to professional treatments is limited and not affordable for everyone. Most of the patients have to be on a waiting list when they urgently need it. Let alone the pandemic situation that adds another barrier to the treatment. There is also a stigma about mental health sufferers. Thus, we want to <b>present a digital product that can help Indonesian people with mental health problems anywhere, anytime, as affordable as possible, and with identity confidentiality</b>.
